    "desc": "<p>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.</p><h4>Short and Stout</h4><p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p><p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p><h4>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h4><p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p><p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p><p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p><h4>Clans and Kingdoms</h4><p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p><p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p><p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p><h4>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h4><p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p>"

They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p><p>Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p><h4>A Timeless Perspective</h4><p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p><p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p><h4>Hidden Woodland Realms</h4><p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p><p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p><h4>Exploration and Adventure</h4><p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>"

    "desc": "<p>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.</p><h4>Small and Practical</h4><p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.</p><p>Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.</p><p>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p><h4>Kind and Curious</h4><p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.</p><p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</p><h4>Blend into the Crowd</h4><p>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.</p><p>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.</p><h4>Pastoral Pleasantries</h4><p>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don't recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p><p>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings' hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p><h4>Exploring Opportunities</h4><p>Halflings usually set out on the adventurer's path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.</p>"

    "name": "Halfling",
    "type": "Race",
    "desc": "<p>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p><h4>A Broad Spectrum</h4><p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</p><h4>Variety in All Things</h4><p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</p><h4>Lasting Institutions</h4><p>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.</p><p>Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</p><h4>Exemplars of Ambition</h4><p>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</p>"

    "type": "Race",
    "desc": "<p>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p><h4>Proud Dragon Kin</h4><p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p><p>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</p><h4>Self-Sufficient Clans</h4><p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p><p>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push them selves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p><p>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods.</p>"

Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.</p><h4>Vibrant Expression</h4><p>A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.</p><p>A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</p><h4>Delighted Dedication</h4><p>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.</p><p>Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.</p><p>Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.</p><h4>Bright Burrows</h4><p>Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.</p><p>Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.</p>"

    "desc": "<p>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p><h4>Of Two Worlds</h4>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they're on par with both parents, though they're neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.</p><h4>Diplomats or Wanderers</h4><p>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.</p><p>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p>"

    "name": "Half-Orc",
    "type": "Race",
    "desc": "<p>Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.</p><h4>Scarred and Strong</h4><p>Half-orcs' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.</p><p>Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.</p><h4>The Mark of Gruumsh</h4><p>The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can't fully escape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh's exultation when they join in melee combat—and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.</p><p>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn'tjust quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self- control to get by in a civilized land.</p><h4>Tribes and Slums</h4><p>Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are most likely to accept half-orcs, and half- orcs almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves among rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of larger cities, half-orcs get by on their physical might, their endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit from their human ancestry.</p>"

    "desc": "<p>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.</p><h4>Infernal Bloodline</h4><p>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle's, and some spiral upward like an antelopes' horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.</p><h4>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h4><p>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p><p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling's companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p>"

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><h4>Primal Instinct</h4><p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature&mdash;keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p><h4>A Life of Danger</h4><p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Som e barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a barbarian you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d12 per barbarian level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 12 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Strength, Constitution<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon</li><li>(a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon</li><li>An explorer's pack and four javelins</li></ul><h4>Rage</h4><p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p><p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</p><ul><li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li><li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown on the rage table.</li><li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li></ul><p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p><p>You rage last for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p><p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p><h4>Unarmored Defense</h4><p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p><h4>Reckless Attack</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p><h4>Danger Sense</h4><p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</p><p>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p><h4>Primal Path</h4><p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Extra Attack</h4><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h4>Fast Movement</h4><p>Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.</p><h4>Feral Instinct</h4><p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p><p>Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p><h4>Brutal Critical</h4><p>Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</p><p>This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</p><h4>Relentless Rage</h4><p>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</p><p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p><h4>Persistent Rage</h4><p>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p><h4>Indomitable Might</h4><p>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p><h4>Primal Champion</h4><p>At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</p><h3>Primal Paths</h3><p>Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.</p><h4>Path of the Berserker</h4><p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end&mdash;that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p><h5>Frenzy</h5><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).</p><h5>Mindless Rage</h5><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p><h5>Intimidating Presence</h5><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p><p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p><h5>Retaliation</h5><p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p><h4>Path of the Totem Warrior</h4><p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p><p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p><h5>Spirit Seeker</h5><p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10.</p><h5>Totem Spirit</h5><p>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick- skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p><p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p><p><b>Bear.</b> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p><p><b>Eagle.</b> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p><p><b>Wolf.</b> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p><h5>Aspect of the Beast</h5><p>At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p><p><b>Bear.</b> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p><p><b>Eagle.</b> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p><b>Wolf.</b> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).</p><h5>Spirit Walker</h5><p>At 10th level, you can cast the <i>commune with nature</i> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p><h5>Totemic Attunement</h5><p>At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p><p><b>Bear.</b> While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p><p><b>Eagle.</b> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p><p><b>Wolf.</b> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.</p>"

    "name": "Bard",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song&mdash;knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p><p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><h4>Music and Magic</h4><p>In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p><h4>Learning from Experience</h4><p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel&mdash;to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon&mdash;makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a bard, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per bard level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> Light armor<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longsword, rapiers, shortsword<br><b>Tools:</b> Three musical instruments of your choice</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Dexterity, Charisma<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose any three</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon</li><li>(a) a diplomat's pack or (b) an entertainer's pack</li><li>(a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument</li><li>Leather armor and a dagger</li></ul><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>cure wounds</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>cure wounds</i> using either slot.</p><p><h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5><p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h5>Ritual Casting</h5><p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p><h4>Bardic Inspiration</h4><p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p><p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p><h4>Jack of All Trades</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.</p><h4>Song of Rest</h4><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p><p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p><h4>Bard College</h4><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h4>Expertise</h4><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Font of Inspiration</h4><p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h4>Countercharm</h4><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p><h4>Magical Secrets</h4><p>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p><p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p><p>You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p><h4>Superior Inspiration</h4><p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p><h3>Bard Colleges</h3><p>The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.</p><h4>College of Lore</h4><p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p><p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p><p>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p><h5>Bonus Proficiencies</h5><p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p><h5>Cutting Words</h5><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.</p><h5>Additional Magical Secrets</h5><p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.</p><h5>Peerless Skill</h5><p>Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.</p><h4>College of Valor</h4><p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the m em ory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p><h5>Bonus Proficiencies</h5><p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</p><h5>Combat Inspiration</h5><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p><h5>Extra Attack</h5><p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h5>Battle Magic</h5><p>At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>"

    "name": "Cleric",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p><p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p><h4>Healers and Warriors</h4><p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p><h4>Divine Agents</h4><p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a cleric, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per cleric level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> Light armor, medium armor, and shields<br><b>Weapons:</b> All simple weapons<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Wisdom, Charisma<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient)</li><li>(a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient)</li><li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li><li>(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li><li>A shield and a holy symbol</li></ul><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity.You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h5>Ritual Casting</h5><p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p><h4>Divine Domain</h4><p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p><h5>Domain Spells</h5><p>Each domain has a list of spells&mdash;its domain spells&mdash;that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Destroy Undead</h4><p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p><table><thead><caption>Destroy Undead</caption><tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Destroys Undead of CR...</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5th</td><td>1/2 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>1 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>2 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>4 or lower</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Divine Intervention</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p><p>Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p><p>If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p><p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p><h3>Divine Domains</h3><p>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity's domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity's portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity's portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.</p><p>Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (\"radiant\") Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (\"healing\"), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.</p><p>Each domain's description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.</p><h4>Knowledge Domain</h4><p>The gods of knowledge&mdash;including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth&mdash;value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</p><table><thead><caption>Knowledge Domain Spells<tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>command, identify</i></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>augury, suggestion</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>nondetection, speak with dead</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>arcane eye, confusion</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>legend lore, scrying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Blessings of Knowledge</h5><p>At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages</h5><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts</h5><p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.</p><p>As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish along rest.</p><p>If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p><p>During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the <i>suggestion</i> spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.</p><h5>Potent Spellcasting</h5><p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h5>Visions of the Past</h5><p>Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><b>Object Reading.</b> Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.</p><p><b>Area Reading.</b> As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.</p><h4>Life Domain</h4><p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy&mdash;one of the fundamental forces of the universe&mdash;that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).</p><table><thead><caption>Life Domain Spells<tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>bless, cure wounds</i></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>lesser restoration, spiritual weapon</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>beacon of hope, revivify</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>death ward, guardian of faith</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>mass cure wounds, raise dead</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Bonus Proficiency</h5><p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p><h5>Disciple of Life</h5><p>Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h5><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.</p><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p><h5>Blessed Healer</h5><p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p><h5>Divine Strike</h5><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h5>Supreme Healing</h5><p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</p><h4>Light Domain</h4><p>Gods of light&mdash;including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty&mdash;promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.</p><table><thead><caption>Light Domain Spells<tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>burning hands, faerie fire</i></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>flaming sphere, scorching ray</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>daylight, fireball</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>guardian of faith, wall of fire</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>flame strike, scrying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Bonus Cantrip</h5><p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the light cantrip if you don't already know it.</p><h5>Warding Flare</h5><p>Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn</h5><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.</p><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p><h5>Improved Flare</h5><p>Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.</p><h5>Potent Spellcasting</h5><p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h5>Corona of Light</h5><p>Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.</p><h4>Nature Domain</h4><p>Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.</p><table><thead><caption>Nature Domain Spells<tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>animal friendship, speak with animals</i></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>barkskin, spike growth</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>plant growth, wind wall</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>dominate beast, grasping vine</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>insect plague, tree stride</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Acolyte of Nature</h5><p>At 1st level, you learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.</p><h5>Bonus Proficiency</h5><p>Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants</h5><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm animals and plants.</p><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.</p><h5>Dampen Elements</h5><p>Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.</p><h5>Divine Strike</h5><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h5>Master of Nature</h5><p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to command animals and plant creatures. While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.</p><h5>Tempest Domain</h5><p>Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain&mdash;including Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor&mdash;govern storms, sea, and sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p><table><thead><caption>Tempest Domain Spells<tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>fog cloud, thunderwave</i></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>gust of wind, shatter</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>call lightning, sleet storm</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>control water, ice storm</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>destructive wave, insect plague</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Bonus Proficiencies</h5><p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.</p><h5>Wrath of the Storm</h5><p>Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h5>Channel Divinity:Destructive Wrath</h5><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity.</p><p>When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.</p><h5>Thunderbolt Strike</h5><p>At 6th level, when you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.</p><h5>Divine Strike</h5><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h5>Stormborn</h5><p>At 17th level, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not underground or indoors.</p><h4>Trickery Domain</h4><p>Gods of trickery&mdash;such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki&mdash;are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.</p><table><thead><caption>Trickery Domain Spells<tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>charm person, disguise self</i></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>mirror image, pass without trace</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>blink, dispel magic</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>dimension door, polymorph</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>dominate person, modify memory</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Blessing of the Trickster</h5>Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity</h5>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.</p><p>As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</p><p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows</h5>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish.</p><p>As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.</p><h5>Divine Strike</h5>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with poison&mdash;a gift from your deity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h5>Improved Duplicity</h5><p>At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.</p><h4>Ware Domain</h4><p>War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p><table><thead><caption>War Domain Spells<tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>divine favor, shield of faith</i></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>magic weapon, spiritual weapon</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>crusader's mantle, spirit guardians</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>freedom of movement, stoneskin</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>flame strike, hold monster</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Bonus Proficiencies</h5><p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.</p><h5>War Priest</h5>From 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you while you are engaged in battle. When you use the Attack action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: Guided Strike</h5><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p><h5>Channel Divinity: War God's Blessing</h5><p>At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p><h5>Divine Strike</h5><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h5>Avatar of Battle</h5><p>At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>"

    "name": "Druid",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p><p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.</p><p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.<?p><p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p><h4>Power of Nature</h4><p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals&mdash;the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p><h4>Preserve the Balance</h4><p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world&mdash;air, earth, fire, and water&mdash;must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a druid, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per cleric level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> Light armor, medium armor, and shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)<br><b>Weapons:</b> Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears<br><b>Tools:</b> Herbalism kit</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Intelligence, Wisdom<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon</li><li>(a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon</li><li>Leather armor, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus</li></ul><h4>Druidic</h4><p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.</p><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h5>Ritual Casting</h5><p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p><h4>Wild Shape</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.</p><table><thead><caption>Beast Shapes</caption><tr><th>Level</th><th>Max. CR</th><th>Limitations</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>1/4</td><td>No flying or swimming speed</td><td>Wolf</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>1/2</td><td>No flying speed</td><td>Crocodile</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>1</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>Giant Eagle</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p><p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p><ul><li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li><li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li><li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <i>call lightning</i>, that you've already cast.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li></ul><h4>Druid Circle</h4><p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Timeless Body</h4><p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p><h4>Beast Spells</h4><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.</p><h4>Archdruid</h4><p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p><p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p><h3>Druid Circles</h3><p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.</p><p>At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p><h4>Circle of the Land</h4><p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</p><h5>Bonus Cantrip</h5><p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p><h5>Natural Recovery</h5><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some ofyour magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p><h5>Circle Spells</h5><p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated list of spells.</p><p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p><table><thead><caption>Arctic</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>hold person, spike growth</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>sleet storm, slow</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>freedom of movement, ice storm</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>commune with nature, cone of cold</i></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><caption>Coast</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>mirror image, misty step</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>water breathing, water walk</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>control water, freedom of movement</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>conjure elemental, scrying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><caption>Desert</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>blur, silence</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>create food and water, protection from energy</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>blight, halluncinatory terrain</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>insect plague, wall of stone</i></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><caption>Forest</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>barkskin, spider climb</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>call lightning, plant growth</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>divination, freedom of movement</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>commune with nature, tree stride</i></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><caption>Grassland</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>invisibility, pass without trace</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>daylight, haste</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>divination, freedom of movement</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>dream, insect plague</i></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><caption>Mountain</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>spider climb, spike growth</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>lightning bolt, meld into stone</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>stone shape, stoneskin</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>passwall, wall of stone</i></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><caption>Swamp</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>darkness, Melf's acid arrow</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>water walk, stinking cloud</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>freedom of movement, locate creature</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>insect plague, scrying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><caption>Underdark</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>spider climb, web</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>gaseous form, stinking cloud</i></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>greater invisibility, stone shape</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>cloudkill, insect plague</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Land's Stride</h5><p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p><h5>Nature's Ward</h5><p>When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p><h5>Nature's Sanctuary</h5><p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p><h4>Circle of the Moon</h4><p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.</p><p>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.</p><h5>Combat Wild Shape</h5><p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.</p><p>Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p><h5>Circle Forms</h5><p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).</p><p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.</p><h5>Primal Strike</h5><p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h5>Elemental Wild Shape</h5><p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.</p><h5>Thousand Forms</h5><p>By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the <i>alter self</i> spell at will."

    "name": "Fighter",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p><p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p><p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight&mdash;and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p><p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings&mdash;as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><h4>Well-Rounded Specialists</h4><p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p><h4>Trained for Danger</h4><p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p><p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards&mdash;few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a fighter, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d10 per fighter level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> All armor, shields<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Strength, Constitution<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) chain mail or (b) leather, longbow, and 20 arrow</li><li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li><li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes</li><li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li></ul><h4>Fighting Style</h4><p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h5>Archery</h5><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p><h5>Defense</h5><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h5>Dueling</h5><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h5>Great Weapon Fighting</h5><p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p><h5>Protection</h5><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h5>Two-Weapon Fighting</h5><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p><h4>Second Wind</h4><p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h4>Action Surge</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p><h4>Martial Archetype</h4><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Extra Attack</h4><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><p>The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.</p><h4>Indomitable</h4><p>Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.</p><h3>Martial Archetypes</h3><p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.</p><h4>Champion</h4><p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.</p><h5>Improved Critical</h5><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><h5>Remarkable Athlete</h5><p>Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.</p><p>In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.</p><h5> Additional Fighting Style</h5><p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.</p><h5>Superior Critical</h5><p>Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.</p><h5>Survivor</h5><p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p><h4>Battle Master</h4><p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, som etim es including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p><h5>Combat Superiority</h5><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p><p><b>Maneuvers.</b> You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under \"Maneuvers\" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.</p><p>You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p><p><b>Superiority Dice.</b> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p><p><b>Saving Throws.</b> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><b>Maneuver save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p><h5>Student of War</h5><p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p><h5>Know Your Enemy</h5><p>Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p><ul><li>Strength score</li><li>Dexterity score</li><li>Constitution score</li><li>Armor Class</li><li>Current hit points</li><li>Total class levels (if any)</li><li>Fighter class levels (if any)</li></ul><h5>Improved Combat Superiority</h5><p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into dl2s.</p><h5>Relentless</h5><p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.</p><h5>Maneuvers</h5><p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p><p><b>Commander's Strike.</b> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p><p><b>Disarming Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p><p><b>Distracting Strike.</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p><p><b>Evasive Footwork.</b> When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p><p><b>Feinting Attack.</b> You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p><p><b>Goading Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p><p><b>Lunging Attack.</b> When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p><p><b>Maneuvering Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p><p><b>Menacing Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p><p><b>Parry.</b> When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.</p><p><b>Precision Attack.</b> When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p><p><b>Pushing Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p><p><b>Rally.</b> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Riposte.</b> When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p><p><b>Sweeping Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p><p><b>Trip Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p><h4>Eldritch Knight</h4><p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjurationand evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p><h5>Spellcasting</h5><p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p><p><b>Cantrips.</b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><p><b>Spell Slots.</b> The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>shield</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>shield</i> using either slot.</p><p><b>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</b> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</p><p><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><table><thead><caption>Eldritch Knight Spellcasting</caption><tr><th colspan=\"3\"></th><th colspan=\"4\">&mdash; Spells Slots per Spell Level &mdash;</th></tr><tr><th>Fighter Level</th><th>Cantrips Known</th><th>Spells Known</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Weapon Bond</h5><p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p><p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p><p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p><h5>War Magic</h5><p>Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p><h5>Eldritch Strike</h5><p>At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p><h5>Arcane Charge</h5><p>At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.</p><h5>Improved War Magic</h5><p>Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>"

    "desc": "<p>Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.</p><p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone's throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth- wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p><p>Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p><h4>The Magic of Ki</h4><p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse&mdash;specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p><h4>Training and Asceticism</h4><p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p><p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p><p>The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p><p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a monk, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per monk level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> None<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, shortswords<br><b>Tools:</b> Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Strength, Dexterity<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon</li><li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li><li>10 darts</li></ul><h4>Unarmored Defense</h4><p>Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p><h4>Martial Arts</h4><p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.</p><p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p><ul><li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li><li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li><li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.</li></ul><p>Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the same statistics provided for it's most closely related weapon.</p><h4>Ki</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p><p>You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p><p>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p><p>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><b>Ki save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h5>Flurry of Blows</h5><p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p><h5>Patient Defense</h5><p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p><h5>Step of the Wind</h5><p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p><h4>Unarmored Movement</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p><p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p><h4>Monastic Tradition</h4><p>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p><h4>Deflect Missiles</h4><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p><p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Slow Fall</h4><p>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p><h4>Extra Attack</h4><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h4>Stunning Strike</h4><p>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><h4>Ki-Empowered Strikes</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h4>Evasion</h4><p>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a <i>fireball</i> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h4>Stillness of Mind</h4><p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p><h4>Purity of Body</h4><p>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p><h4>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h4><p>Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p><h4>Diamond Soul</h4><p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p><h4>Timeless Body</h4><p>At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p><h4>Empty Body</h4><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p><p>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <i>astral projection</i> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.</p><h4>Perfect Self</h4><p>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p><h3>Monastic Traditions</h3><p>Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.</p><h4>Way of the Open Hand</h4>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.</p><h5>Open Hand Technique</h5><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p><ul><li>It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li><li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li><li>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li></ul><h5>Wholeness of Body</h5><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p><h5>Tranquility</h5><p>Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><h5>Quivering Palm</h5><p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p><p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.</p><h4>Way of Shadow</h4><p>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.</p><h5>Shadow Arts</h5><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the minor illusion cantrip if you don't already know it.</p><h5>Shadow Step</h5><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.</p><h5>Cloak of Shadows</h5><p>By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p><h5>Opportunist</h5><p>At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.</p><h4>Way of the Four Elements</h4><p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension ofyour body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.</p><p>Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</p><h5>Disciple of the Elements</h5><p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</p><p>You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the \"Elemental Disciplines\" section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p><p>Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</p><p><b>Casting Elemental Spells.</b> Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.</p><p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as <i>burning hands</i> does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast <i>burning hands</i>, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p><p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p><table><thead><caption>Spells and Ki Points</caption><tr><th>Monk Levels</th><th>Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5th-8th</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9th-12th</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>13th-16th</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>17th-20th</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Elemental Disciplines</h5><p>The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order. If a discipline requires a level, you must be that level in this class to learn the discipline.</p><p><b>Breath of Winter (17th Level Required).</b> You can spend 6 ki points to cast <i>cone of cold</i>.</p><p><b>Clench of the North Wind (6th Level Required).</b> You can spend 3 ki points to cast <i>hold person</i>.</p><p><b>Elemental Attunement.</b> You can use your action to briefly control elemental forces nearby, causing one of the following effects of your choice:</p><ul><li>Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.</li><li>Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li><li>Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.</li><li>Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.</li></ul><p><b>Eternal Mountain Defense (11th Level Required).</b> You can spend 5 ki points to cast <i>stoneskin</i>, targeting yourself.</p><p><b>Fangs of the Fire Snake.</b> When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause tendrils of flame to stretch out from your fists and feet. Your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet for that action, as well as the rest of the turn. A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and if you spend 1 ki point when the attack hits, it also deals an extra 1d10 fire damage.</p><p><b>Fist of Four Thunders.</b> You can spend 2 ki points to cast <i>thunderwave</i>.</p><p><b>Fist of Unbroken Air.</b> You can create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't push it or knock it prone.</p><p><b>Flames of the Phoenix (11th Level Required).</b> You can spend 4 ki points to cast <i>fireball</i>.</p><p><b>Gong of the Summit (6th Level Required).</b> You can spend 3 ki points to cast <i>shatter</i>.</p><p><b>Mist Stance (11th Level Required).</b> You can spend 4 ki points to cast <i>gaseous form</i>, targeting yourself.</p><p><b>Ride the Wind (11th LevelRequired).</b> You can spend 4 ki points to cast <i>fly</i>, targeting yourself.</p><p><b>River of Hungry Flame (17th Level Required).</b> You can spend 5 ki points to cast <i>wall of fire</i>.</p><p><b>Rush of the Gale Spirits.</b> You can spend 2 ki points to cast <i>gust of wind</i>.</p><p><b>Shape the Flowing River.</b> As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to choose an area of ice or water no larger than 30 feet on a side within 120 feet of you. You can change water to ice within the area and vice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the ice's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to 15 feet deep, and so on. You can't shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.</p><p><b>Sweeping Cinder Strike.</b> You can spend 2 ki points to cast <i>burning hands</i>.</p><p><b>Water Whip.</b> You can spend 2 ki points as a bonus action to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it prone.</p><p><b>Wave of Rolling Earth (17th Level Required).</b. You can spend 6 ki points to cast <i>wall of stone</i>.</p>"

    "name": "Paladin",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two ores are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><h4>The Cause of Righteousness</h4><p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p><h4>Beyond the Mundane Life</h4><p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a paladin, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d10 per paladin level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> All armor, shields<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Wisdom, Charisma<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li><li>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li><li>(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li><li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li></ul><h4>Divine Sense</h4>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <i>hallow</i> spell.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p><h4>Lay on Hands</h4><p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.</p><p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p><p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p><h4>Fighting Style</h4><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h5>Defense</h5><p>When you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h5>Dueling</h5><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h5>Great Weapon Fighting</h5><p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p><h5>Protection</h5><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <i>cure wounds</i>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p><h4>Divine Smite</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.</p><h4>Divine Health</h4><p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p><h4>Sacred Oath</h4><p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p><h5>Oath Spells</h5><p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p><h5>Channel Divinity</h5><p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Extra Attack</h4><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h4>Aura of Protection</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h4>Aura of Courage</h4><p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h4>Improved Divine Smite</h4><p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.</p><h4>Cleansing Touch</h4><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Sacred Oaths</h3><p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination ofallthepaladin'straining.Somecharacterswiththis class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p><h4>Oath of Devotion</h4><p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals ofjustice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels&mdash;the perfect servants of good&mdash;as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p><h5>Tenets of Devotion</h5>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p><p><b>Honesty.</b> Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</p><p><b>Courage.</b> Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p><p><b>Compassion.</b> Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</p><p><b>Honor.</b> Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</p><p><b>Duty.</b> Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</p><h5>Oath Spells</h5><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><table><thead><caption>Oath of Devotion Spells</caption><tr><th>Paladin Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>protection from evil and good, sanctuary</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>lesser restoration, zone of truth</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>beacon of hope, dispel magic</i></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><i>freedom of movement, guardian of faith</i></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><i>commune, flame strike</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Channel Divinity</h5><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><b>Sacred Weapon.</b> As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becom es magical for the duration.</p><p>You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p><p><b>Turn the Unholy.</b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><h5>Aura of Devotion</h5><p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h5>Purity of Spirit</h5><p>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a <i>protection from evil and good</i> spell.</p><h5>Holy Nimbus</h5><p>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.</p><p>Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.</p><p>In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Oath of the Ancients</h4><p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things&mdash;leaves, antlers, or flowers&mdash;to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p><h5>Tenets of the Ancients</h5><p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</p><p><b>Kindle the Light.</b> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</p><p><b>Shelter the Light.</b> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</p><p><b>Preserve Your Own Light.</b> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.</p><p><b>Be the Light.</b> Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</p><h5>Oath Spells</h5><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><table><thead><caption>Oath of the Ancients Spells</caption><tr><th>Paladin Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>ensnaring strike, speak with animals</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>moonbeam, misty step</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>plant growth, protection from energy</i></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><i>ice storm, stoneskine</i></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><i>comune with nature, tree stride</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><b>Nature's Wrath.</b> You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</p><p><b>Turn the Faithless.</b> You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><p>If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p><h5>Aura of Warding</h5><p>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h5>Undying Sentinel</h5><p>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.</p><h5>Elder Champion</h5><p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.</p><p>Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</li><li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li><li>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvan tage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Oath of Vengeance</h4><p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside&mdash;at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins&mdash; sometimes called avengers or dark knights&mdash;their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</p><h5>Tenets of Vengeance</h5><p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</p><p><b>Fight the Greater Evil.</b> Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.</p><p><b>No Mercy for the Wicked.</b> Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</p><p><b>By Any Means Necessary.</b> My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.</p><p><b>Restitution.</b> If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</p><h5>Oath Spells</h5><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><table><thead><caption>Oath of Vengeance Spells</caption><tr><th>Paladin Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>bane, hunter's mark</i></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>hold person, misty step</i></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>haste, protection from energy</i></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><i>banishment, dimension door</i></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><i>hold monster, scrying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><b>Abjure Enemy.</b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p><p>On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p><p><b>Vow of Enmity.</b> As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p><h5>Relentless Avenger</h5><p>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.</p><h5>Soul of Vengeance</h5><p>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p><h5>Avenging Angel</h5><p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li><li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become fright ened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>"

    "name": "Ranger",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p><p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p><p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p><h4>Deadly Hunters</h4><p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization&mdash;humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p><h4>Independent Adventurers</h4><p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In som e places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first&mdash;and possibly the last&mdash;line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a ranger, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d10 per ranger level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Strength, Dexterity<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li> (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor</li><li>(a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons</li><li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li><li>A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li></ul><h4>Favored Enemy</h4><p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p><p>Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p><p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p><p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p><p>You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p></h4>Natural Explorer</h4><p>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.</p><p>While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li></li>Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.<li></li>Your group can't become lost except by magical means.<li></li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.<li></li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.<li></li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.<li></li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li></ul><p>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p><h4>Fighting Style</h4><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h5>Archery</h5><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p><h5>Defense</h5><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h5>Dueling</h5><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h5>Two-Weapon Fighting</h5><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.</p><h5>SpellSlots</h5><p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>animal friendship</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>animal friendship</i> using either slot.</p><h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h4>Ranger Archetype</h4><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p><h4>Primeval Awareness</h4><p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Extra Attack</h4><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h4>Land's Stride</h4><p>Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <i>entangle</i> spell.</p><h4>Hide in Plain Sight</h4><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p><p>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p><h4>Vanish</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p><h4>Feral Senses</h4><p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p><p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.</p><h4>FoeSlayer</h4><p>At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>"

    "name": "Rogue",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accom plice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><h4>Skill and Precision</h4><p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p><h4>A Shady Living</h4><p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a rogue, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per rogue level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> Light armor<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br><b>Tools:</b> Thieves' tools</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Dexterity, Intelligence<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword</li><li>(a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword</li><li>(a) a burglar's pack, (b) a dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack</li><li>Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools</li></ul><h4>Expertise</h4><p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.</p><h4>Sneak Attack</h4><p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p><p>You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p><p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p><h4>Thieves' Cant</h4><p>During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p><h4>Cunning Action</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p><h4>Roguish Archetype</h4><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Uncanny Dodge</h4><p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p><h4>Evasion</h4><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an <i>ice storm</i> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h4>Reliable Talent</h4><p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p><h4>Blindsense</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p><h4>Slippery Mind</h4><p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p><h4>Elusive</h4><p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.</p><h4>Stroke of Luck</h4><p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>"

    "name": "Sorcerer",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><h4>Raw Magic</h4><p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p><h4>Unexplained Powers</h4><p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d6 per sorcerer level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 6 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> None<br><b>Weapons:</b> Daggers, dart, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Dexterity, Intelligence<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li><li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li><li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li><li>Two daggers</li></ul><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>burning hands</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>burning hands</i> using either slot.</p><h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p><h4>Sorcerous Origin</h4><p>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes thesource of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p><h4>Font of Magic</h4><p>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p><h5>Sorcery Points</h5><p>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p><h5>Flexible Casting</h5><p>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.</p><p><b>Creating Spell Slots.</b> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.</p><table><thead><caption>Creating Spell Slots</caption><tr><th>Spell Slot Level</th><th>Sorcery Point Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.</b> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.</p><h4>Metamagic</h4><p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spellsto suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.</p><p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p><h5>Careful Spell</h5><p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</p><h5>Distant Spell</h5><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.</p><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p><h5>Empowered Spell</h5><p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p><p>You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p><h5>Extended Spell</h5><p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p><h5>Heightened Spell</h5><p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</p><h5>Quickened Spell</h5><p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p><h5>Subtle Spell</h5><p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p><h5>Twinned Spell</h5><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

    "name": "Warlock",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><h4>Sworn and Beholden</h4><p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity&mdash;beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p><h4>Delvers into Secrets</h4><p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a warlock, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per warlock level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> Light armor<br><b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Wisdom, Charisma<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li><li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li><li>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack</li><li>Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</li></ul><h4>Otherworldly Patron</h4><p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h4>Pact Magic</h4><p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <i>thunderwave</i>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p><h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5><p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p><h4>Eldritch Invocations</h4><p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</p><p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p><h4>Pact Boon</h4><p>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p><h5>Pact of the Chain</h5><p>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</p><p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own.</p><h5>Pact of the Blade</h5><p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p> Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p><h5>Pact of the Tome</h5><p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h4>Mystic Arcanum</h4><p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p><p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p><p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Eldritch Master</h4><p>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>"

    "name": "Wizard",
    "type": "Class",
    "desc": "<p>Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p><p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p><p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p><p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><h4>Scholars of the Arcane</h4><p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p><p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p><h4>The Lure of Knowledge</h4><p>Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a wizard, you gain the following class features.</p><h5>Hit Points</h5><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d6 per wizard level<br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 6 + your Constitution modifier<br><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p><h5>Proficiencies</h5><p><b>Armor:</b> None<br><b>Weapons:</b> Daggers, darts, slings, quartstaffs, light crossbows<br><b>Tools:</b> None</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Intelligence, Wisdom<br><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger</li><li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li><li>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li><li>A spellbook</li></ul><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p><h5>Spellbook</h5><p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <i>magic missile</i>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</p><h5>Ritual Casting</h5><p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><h5>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5><p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the \"Your Spellbook\" section).</p><h4> Arcane Recovery</h4><p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p><p>For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.
